There was a crime on TU grounds, read this blog post to find out what
happened!

Today some friends and I were searching for a place to sit and work at the
Inffeld Campus of the TU Graz. We went by every study center of which we
could think, but there were no free seats anywhere. So we went to the
IICM (Institute of Information Systems and Computer Media), where we
luckily found some seats.

But one table was blocked off by a red caution tape. We immediately assessed
the situation. The only possible explanation was that a student died while
studying too hard.

Daniel said to me I should make a blog post about this. I said yeah, finally
I have something I can write about. Now in retrospective, this post is rather
disappointing. I tried to make it as click-baity as possible. I gotta do
some research on Buzzfeed for my next posts I suppose.
