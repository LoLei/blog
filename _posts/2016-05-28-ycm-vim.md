How to fix the liblang 3.7 error in YouCompleteMe for Vim if you just updated
clang and llvm to 3.8

---

If you've just updated your llvm and clang to version 3.8 you might encounter 
the following error in YouCompleteMe for Vim: 

`ImportError: libclang.so.3.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`  
<sub>Hint: Check for this error by running: `:YCMToggleLogs stderr`</sub>

The simplest fix for me was to just recompile YCM, for me as I installed it
with bundle, it was as simple as:  

`cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe`
`./install.py`

Then just restart Vim and voil√†!
