So far this blog has been really meta, this will be the first post which
actually addresses something outside of the blog itself.

Some years ago (I think 2), during my mandatory community service, I made
a website which counts the days that passed since the release of the game
Half-Life 2: Episode 2, which is the latest installment of the Half-Life
series.

Fans have been waiting for years for the next release, because (mild spoiler:)
Half-Life 2: Episode 2 ends on a cliffhanger.

The counter does not help to ease the pain waiting, it has almost been 3000
days.

Anyways, check out the counter [here](http://lolei.github.io/hl2-counter).

I also made a counter with the same concept about the Game Of Thrones books,
alias "A Song Of Ice And Fire". You can view this website
[here](http://lolei.github.io/got-counter).
