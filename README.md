# My personal blog

This is my personal blog built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium). (So far)

The blog is maintained separately from the [main website hub](http://lolei.github.io). :octocat:
