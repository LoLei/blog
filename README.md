# My personal blog

This is my personal blog built using
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll),
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now),
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium). (So far)

The blog is maintained separately from the
[main website hub](http://lolei.github.io). :octocat:

All the commits I make on `master` are pushed automatically to the `gh-pages`
branch so they are viewable on the live website.
