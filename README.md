# My personal blog

This is my personal blog built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium). (So far)

The blog is maintained separately from the [main website hub](http://lolei.github.io), and the development and commits are made on the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/LoLei/blog/tree/gh-pages) branch of [LoLei/blog](https://github.com/LoLei/blog). :octocat:  

This also means all the files you see in the `master` branch are probably outdated.  
(TODO@me: clean up `master` branch.)
